# Rules: linter

## Context & Responsibility
This ruleset defines the standards for the `@ai-workflows/linter` module. This module is responsible for verifying architectural compliance across the project, ensuring that file structures, naming conventions, and `AGENTS.md` configurations adhere to the "Scope-Aware" architecture.

## Operational Standards
- Verification: Run `bun run --cwd linter build` to check compilation. Use `bun run --cwd linter lint` to execute the linter against the codebase.
- Deployment: Build artifacts to `dist/`. No external deployment specified; internal tool.

## Capability Graph
- @skill/rules-creator
- @skill/skill-creator

## Development Guidelines
- Runtime/Environment: Bun, TypeScript.
- Architecture Patterns: Command-line Interface (CLI), Static Analysis.

## Delegation & Boundaries
- Inheritance: Inherits from @rules/root
- Focus: Strictly focuses on the implementation of the linter logic. Does not define project-wide rules itself, but enforces them via code.
