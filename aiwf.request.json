  "request_id": "REQ-NIBBLE-WORKER-VLLM-0004",
  "objective": "Restore runtime compatibility on hosts with older NVIDIA drivers and stop false-failing dependency updater CI runs.",
  "scope": "Update Dockerfile CUDA/runtime wheel targets to a broader-compatible baseline and harden .github/workflows/CI-runpod_dep.yml so unpinned runpod dependencies do not fail the workflow.",
  "risk_tier": "T1-medium",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Dockerfile no longer requires CUDA 12.9 host-driver compatibility at container start.",
    "vLLM install path uses CUDA 12.8 wheel index to match the downgraded runtime base image.",
    "CI-runpod_dep workflow exits cleanly when runpod is unpinned or absent instead of failing.",
    "Dependency updater still updates managed runpod pins when a newer major.minor is detected.",
    "No upstream interactions or new secret requirements are introduced."
  ],
  "tests_expected": [
    "docker buildx bake --print",
    "python -m json.tool aiwf.request.json >/dev/null",
    "Review CI-runpod_dep script logic for unpinned runpod skip path",
    "Run CI | Update runpod package version via workflow_dispatch and verify success",
    "Run container startup test on target host to confirm CUDA requirement error is resolved"
  ],
  "rollback_plan": "Revert Dockerfile CUDA/wheel changes and CI-runpod_dep script updates to restore previous runtime target and updater behavior.",
  "deploy_plan": "Apply and validate only in this fork, then verify with fork-local CI and a runtime smoke test on the target GPU driver environment.",
  "threat_model": "Primary risks are runtime incompatibility from CUDA baseline mismatch and CI noise from brittle parser logic; mitigated by lowering the CUDA requirement baseline and making updater parsing explicit with safe skip conditions.",
  "ambiguities": []
