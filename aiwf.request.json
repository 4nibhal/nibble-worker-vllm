  "version": 1,
  "request_id": "REQ-NIBBLE-WORKER-VLLM-0002",
  "objective": "Make this fork pass RunPod Hub serverless listing requirements while keeping fork-only governance and secure defaults.",
  "scope": "Add required .runpod/tests.json, keep serverless handler discoverability intact, add fork badge to root README, and preserve no-secret test config for safe public listing metadata.",
  "risk_tier": "T1-medium",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "File .runpod/tests.json exists with valid JSON schema-compatible test entries and non-secret environment values.",
    "Legacy path .runpod/tests_json is removed to avoid Hub validation misses caused by wrong filename.",
    "Root README.md contains the fork badge URL for 4nibhal/nibble-worker-vllm.",
    "src/handler.py remains the active RunPod serverless entrypoint for Docker CMD execution."
  ],
  "tests_expected": [
    "python -m json.tool .runpod/tests.json",
    "python -m py_compile src/handler.py"
  ],
  "rollback_plan": "Revert the commit that adds .runpod/tests.json, removes .runpod/tests_json, and updates README badge + request contract.",
  "deploy_plan": "Apply and validate only in this fork, then create a GitHub release in this fork so RunPod Hub can ingest the listing changes.",
  "threat_model": "Primary risks are secret leakage in test metadata and mis-detected serverless readiness from incorrect filenames; mitigated by explicit non-secret env examples and canonical .runpod/tests.json path.",
  "ambiguities": []
}
